# Multi-Agent Workflow Optimizer (Learning Project)

This is a beginner-friendly Python project simulating a simple multi-agent system to perform and optimize tasks.

## Purpose

This project serves as a practical learning exercise in Python, focusing on the design and implementation of a multi-agent system. The primary goals are:
- To explore and understand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.
- To simulate a workflow where different "agents" (software components) collaborate to manage and optimize tasks.
- To gain experience in task automation, agent-based modeling, and basic software architecture.
- To practice software development best practices, including version control with Git, writing clear documentation, and iterative development.
The system aims to model a simplified environment where tasks are created, planned, executed, and optimized by specialized agents, providing a tangible way to learn about distributed responsibilities and inter-component communication.

## What It Does

- Planner agents create tasks with random priorities
- Optimizer agents adjust how the tasks are executed based on the priority
- Logs agent actions and tracks task history

## Still Learning...

This project is **not production-ready** — it's a work-in-progress as I continue learning.
I'm adding features step by step, and documenting my progress using Git commits and milestone logs.

## Skills I'm Practicing
- Python classes and methods
- Random module
- Git & GitHub
- Writing clean code
- Logging project milestones

## Completed
- Set up GitHub repo
- Built base agent classes
- Created a working simulation loop
- Logged milestones

## Next Steps

The following enhancements are planned for the project:

-   **Enhance Agent Collaboration:** Improve the logic for how different agents interact and share information to make more coordinated decisions.
-   **Implement a Shared Task Queue:** Develop a robust, centralized queue for managing tasks, allowing agents to pick up, process, and update task statuses efficiently.
-   **Introduce Basic AI Capabilities:**
    -   **Smarter Task Prioritization:** Explore using simple machine learning models or rule-based systems to enable agents to learn from historical task data (e.g., completion times, success rates) and make more intelligent decisions about task prioritization and resource allocation.
    -   **Adaptive Optimization:** Allow the Optimizer agent to adapt its strategies based on observed patterns or feedback, potentially using reinforcement learning concepts in a simplified manner.
    -   **(Future Exploration) LLM Integration:** Consider integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks like natural language understanding of task descriptions, generating task plans, or providing more sophisticated decision support to agents.
-   **Improve Logging and Monitoring:** Enhance the logging mechanism for better traceability and implement a basic monitoring dashboard to visualize agent activity and system performance.
-   **Expand Agent Roles:** Introduce new agent types with specialized skills to handle a wider variety of tasks or aspects of the workflow.
-   **Refine UI/Visualization:** If feasible, develop a simple user interface or visualization tool to better observe the multi-agent system in action.
