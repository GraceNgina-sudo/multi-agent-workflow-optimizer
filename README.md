# Multi-Agent Workflow Optimizer (Learning Project)

This is a beginner-friendly Python project simulating a simple multi-agent system to perform and optimize tasks.

## Purpose

I'm currently learning Python, and this project is part of my hands-on learning journey. The idea is to:
- Understand object-oriented programming
- Practice task automation using simple agents
- Simulate collaboration between different roles (planner, optimizer)

## What It Does

- Planner agents create tasks with random priorities
- Optimizer agents adjust how the tasks are executed based on the priority
- Logs agent actions and tracks task history

## Still Learning...

This project is **not production-ready** — it's a work-in-progress as I continue learning.
I'm adding features step by step, and documenting my progress using Git commits and milestone logs.

## Skills I'm Practicing
- Python classes and methods
- Random module
- Git & GitHub
- Writing clean code
- Logging project milestones

## Completed
- Set up GitHub repo
- Built base agent classes
- Created a working simulation loop
- Logged milestones

## Next Steps
- Add agent collaboration logic
- Store tasks in a shared queue
- Add simple intelligence (learning from task history)
